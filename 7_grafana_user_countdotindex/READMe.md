Create users using index number in list , the problem with this method is that by deleting user1, the system thinks that user1 has been renamed to user2 .
when we use a list, the member of list are identified by their index number,
the system work with index number in list.
By changing the name of user1 to user2, the permission of user1 is given to user2.
